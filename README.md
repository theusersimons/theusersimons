## Hello 👋

- 🔭 I am a backend engineer. I mainly work on private projects and try to contribute to the open source community. My main specialization is web development (Node.js and TypeScript). I am also interested in everything related to the server side (Linux, Docker, K8S, etc). Recently, I make time for the NestJS framework to building microservices, as well as the platform RAGE MP.
- 💡 Most of all are interested in projects related to gambling, gaming, cryptocurrecies, etc.
- 💫 The creator of [JolyBell](https://jolybell.com), [Aridle](https://vk.com/aridle).
- 🍁 I’m looking to collaborate on any exciting opensource (and also private, hehe) projects!
